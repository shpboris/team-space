Team Space app

1.1
Multiple datasources/transaction managers

The TS app runs with two pairs of datasources/transaction managers.
One pair for TS app itself, other - for Spring batch.

a)
TS app persistence is configured in PersistenceConfig.
Data source bean has a custom not standard name of "getBasicDataSource".
Mybatis uses this datasource.

The transaction manager has custom not standard name of txManager which uses
data source "getBasicDataSource".

Code in UserServiceImpl explicitly uses custom transaction manager like this
@Transactional("txManager").

All of the above makes TS app to explicitly use the custom DS and transaction manager above
and not to load any random Spring bean.

b)
In my project Spring Batch uses InfrastructureConfigurationImpl for its persitence config.
DefaultBatchConfigurer is created and is beaing provided DataSource bean with standard name.
Later data source is injected again into DefaultBatchConfigurer since its setter is marked
with @Autowire. Spring context have two datasources "getBasicDataSource" and "DataSource".
So Spring can't make decision which to autowire based on type. So it proceeds to fallback by bean name
and injects "DataSource" bean and uses it for transaction manager !!! Thats how TS and Spring batch use
two different pairs of datasource/transaction manager.

c)
Stopping the job is the only transactional operation of job operator.
So during this operation there is an attempt to find transaction manager which
fails due to having 2 transaction manager in context - one for team space app DB and another is
for to Spring batch DB. To force the job operator to select a its own transaction manager, CustomJobOperator
was created and its "stop" method explicitly specifies transaction manager as @Transactional("transactionManager").

d)
H2 DB is running in mixed mode - i.e local app connects directly to DB in embedded mode.
All external apps/tools connect to TCP server and the server (that runs within the same JVM ?)
forwards the requests to DB.
